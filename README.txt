name of file: Exercise 1: counting lights
*created on 12th, September, 2015;
*code cried from Arduino Intro Labs for Tangible Computing
(http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~c274/web/ArduinoIntro/section/lab_TugOfWar.htm)

Accessories:
*560 Ohm (Green Blue Brown) resistor
*LED
*Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
*wires
*2 pushbuttons
*an USB cable
*a breadboard

Wiring instructions:
Arduino DigitalPin 9<Ñ>Longer LED lead |LED|(1st RED) shorter LED lead<Ñ>560 ohm Resistor<Ñ>Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin 10<Ñ>Longer LED lead |LED|(2nd RED) shorter LED lead<Ñ>560 ohm Resistor<Ñ>Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin 11<Ñ>Longer LED lead |LED|(3rd GREEN) shorter LED lead<Ñ>560 ohm Resistor<Ñ>Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin 12,<Ñ>Longer LED lead |LED|(4th RED) shorter LED lead<Ñ>560 ohm Resistor<Ñ>Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin 13<Ñ>Longer LED lead |LED|(5th RED) shorter LED lead<Ñ>560 ohm Resistor<Ñ>Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin 7<Ñ>increment pushbutton<Ñ> Arduino GND
Arduino DigitalPin6<Ñ>decrement pushbutton<Ñ> Arduino GND
Arduino 5V<Ñ> the supply voltage of bus strips on the breadboard

Instructions:
Open the (counting lights) file of Geany IDE in VM (virtual machine)
check the circuits on the breadboard and the Arduino Mega are correct 
Check the procedures are accurate
Connect the USB cable to the computer
make upload and click the pushbuttons and count the lights
observe the lights 
Finish

Assumptions:
none
